Our [final writeup](https://github.com/Leo-Berman/Treadmill-To-Walking-Pad/blob/ad434f6aecd6edc79e3246cf7f7f194d2eee7e87/Final_Paper/Treadmill-To-Walking-Desk_Final_Paper.pdf) for this project! 
In terms of the languages we used, LaTeX was only used for the final paper write up and the C++ was auto-detected where we were actually using Arduino. We really hope you guys enjoy this paper.
