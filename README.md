Our [final writeup](https://github.com/Leo-Berman/Treadmill-To-Walking-Pad/blob/ad434f6aecd6edc79e3246cf7f7f194d2eee7e87/Final_Paper/Treadmill-To-Walking-Desk_Final_Paper.pdf) for this project! (Note the html website is only chrome compatible at the moment and I haven't yet been able to figure out how to launch the Svelte site from Github Pages so if you want to check it out you have to run it on your local machine).

In terms of the languages we used, LaTeX was only used for the final paper write up and the C++ was auto-detected where we were actually using Arduino. We really hope you guys enjoy this paper.
Here's our [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N29aYL1at1YB_VjGNjzPlnmqFIkKpkeo?usp=drive_link) with pictures and videos.

Note: I need to add the part about setting up a venv for the site :o.
